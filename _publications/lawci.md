title: "On Lattices for Cryptography"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/lawci
excerpt: 'In this survey paper, we discuss properties of lattices from a cryptographic perspective. We clarify relations between Geometry, Algebraic Number Theory and Cryptography, with a focus on the application of lattices to encoding and encrypting sensitive data. In Lattice-based Cryptography, these relations are described by cryptographic schemes whose security relies on hard instances of computational problems over lattices. We address here lattice-based and related problems and the choice of system parameters to securely instantiate them.'
